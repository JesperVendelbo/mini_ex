In this mini_ex3 I’ve made a throbber. But before the throbber appears you have to click the screen so that the page start loading. My idea with this was to show the irritation of trying to load a webpage. I couldn’t figure out how to make some time go by after you click and until the throbber appears. In that way I could’ve made it more annoying and added some more clicks. I tried to make the throbber myself, but after some hours I had to turn to Winnies sketch. I’ve modified almost everything from Winnie’s sketch, to get a good understanding of what is happening with one rectangle and the illusion of it moving by drawing a transparent rect() continuously. My thoughts about the throbber icon, is that it’s kind of annoying. I would always prefer a progress line instead, so that I know how long time it will take. I know some things are happening in the computer, but the throbber icon doesn’t tell me how long it will take or what is going on. The progress bar is therefore nicer in that way that I know how long it will take and then I can wait without being impatient. It think the throbber is just an easy and annoying way to let the user know that you’ve got to wait now.
