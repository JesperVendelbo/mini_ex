For this mini_ex4 I’ve made a question: “you thirsty?” and the answers to this question is not yes or no. It’s possible to answer in two ways: “yes” or “very”. Then if you click either of the buttons pictures of a cocio and a mathilde cocoa appears and then you can click on a button that says “Mathilde” or “cocio”. If you click the cocio button the program afterwards says that: “according to our data you are a giant cocio lover”. The same goes for Mathilde, just that you are a Mathilde lover of course. 

The theme for this mini_ex is capturing data and the exhibition “CAPTURE ALL”. By this program I want to show my interpretation of how big companies gather information about me. If I search for an offer on an object online, then the next time I open facebook, Instagram or other websites, it’s most likely I then see an ad for this object. I think it’s both creepy and uncomfortable that these big websites know so much about us. My program here expresses how fast conclusions are made from clicking a button online until you get a newsletter on mail or you see a commercial. Just because you’ve clicked on either Mathilde or cocio then you are all of a sudden a cocoa lover. Just because of clicking on a cocio button doesn’t make you love cocio, but all the data e.g. facebook got on you aren’t all true either, and that I think is quite creepy.
