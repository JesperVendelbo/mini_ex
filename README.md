This first experience of programming was quite confusing. The first texts we’ve been reading in Aesthetical Programming and Software Studies says that learning programming is like learning a new language. I can see that now. It’s a special feeling that I have to tell the computer everything I want it to do when I’m used to the computer doing everything for me. But the concept of computational thinking is clear to me now (I think so). It is kind of overwhelming that I have to think everything so that the computer can understand it.   
I haven’t got any experience with programming, so therefore it took some time for me to figure out how the p5.js library works in relation to atom and how these two interact and end up showing my codes in a browser. I’ve still got some difficulties when something is wrong with the codes and when trying to figure out how atom, p5.js and the browser work together. But what is clear to me is the concept of computational thinking.  
My overall thoughts about learning how to program are quite positive now. I think it’s fun when I’ve found something exciting to do on the p5.js website and then modify it in atom. This also means that It is very frustrating when something doesn’t work out. But hopefully when trying and playing will help me have a better understanding of it all.

I think the coding process is in some way similar to writing a paper. In both processes you have to think about the build-up, but with programming it’s necessary that the structure is totally correct. Because if just a single comma is placed wrong, then the code will not work properly. This is where the coding process differ the most from writing a paper. 

I think the possibilities with coding practice are almost limitless. There are so many possible ways to combine shapes, colours etc. and therefore it’s important to think about the choices I make in the process of making a program.
