## The program

For this mini_ex7 I’ve collaborated with Thomas Mathiassen og Jakob Duus. We’ve made a e-lit program based on the children song “This old man”.  In relation to the text “Vocable Code”, where one of the first points in the text is that a lot of software use loops. Our e-lit doesn’t use loops, because if our program should’ve have used loops, then it would have been a very short program. And this poem is originally written with the intention that the verses are very identical, like children songs often are. So if we made it into one verse, where e.g. an array would changes the small changes for every verse then the it wouldn’t look like a poem.
When thinking of an e-lit, I thought it would be easy to write a story in p5.js language. But as we in the group tried to write the children song in p5.js language it was clear that it is quite complex to rewrite an English song into p5.js language. This is also something Edsger Dijkstra highlights in the text: “whereas machines must be able to execute programs (without understanding them), people must be able to understand them (without executing them). These two activities are so utterly disconnected –the one can take place without the other.” He says that the world of programs and people are totally separate. Of course the computer operates in another way than how we as humans solve a task. Therefore, I also think it’s actually quite nice to see an English language story modified into JavaScript language.   
The most characteristic thing about our program is that we have written a totally normal English song into JavaScript language. It’s not possible without some parts of the song will be left out. And the most important thing is that the code works, despite not doing anything besides showing a youtube video of the song. We could have chosen to write it in a more complex way so that the code could do something, but we prefer to make a “fake” code, so that you still can see it’s a story.
