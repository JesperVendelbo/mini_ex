Well this mini_ex5 turned out to be harder than I thought. I tried to make a primitive game based on shiffmans videos about arrays, but i couldn't make it work. I would like to make a game where you had to pop the different shapes that would appear according to time and then the shapes would react would get bigger or disappear. I couldn’t figure out how to point out which shape from the array that the program should make bigger or make disappear. Although my primary goal was to learn how a class can help you when dublicating it many times. Unfortunately my code doesn’t show this that great, but I had to make it quite simple to get It to work so that It can show a class appearing when mousePressed ().
I think the reason we are encouraged to make primitive games I this mini_ex5 is because classes are very relevant when making games. When using object-oriented programming it’s easier to make multiple objects fast and make them differ in parameters such as color, size, placement, speed etc.. Also the code is better organized and easier to change because you can work with the class-based objects without making changes in the actual class. When programming games this an advantage because games contain similar objects with similar attributes and functions.
